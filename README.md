# The smart contract pre-launch checklist
## Purpose
Create a list of important tasks and gotchas to check for before launching a
smart contract. This is not meant to be a security guide.
This is a generic guide and does not cover cases specific to each contractâ€™s
use case.


Feel free to make PRs for things I may have missed.
